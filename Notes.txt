soup=BeautifulSoup(response.text,'html.parser')
path=r"P:\Working Directories\Web Scrapping\Web Scrapping Training\file.html"
with open(path,'w') as file:
    file.write(str(soup))



1. In this code remeber soup is the soup  is the object of BeautifulSoup therefore you would need add str for soup to parse it
2. Also r would be required to  read the path from source and considered path as string literal not breakable string
